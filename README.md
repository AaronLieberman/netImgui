**[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) remote connection library.**

Add the capability of sending your ‘Dear ImGui’ drawing to a remote netImgui application and receives back the mouse/keyboard inputs. 

Useful to unclutter your main program display from debug UI elements and give remote control access to a program on hardware without input. My main target for this project is to help with gaming console development.

This library includes the server netImgui application and the code to integrate in your own software.

Thank you to [Omar Cornut](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/commits?author=ocornut) for developing ‘Dear ImGui’.
